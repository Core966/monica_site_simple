This application uses part of the code of the "sinatra-activerecord" gem made by Blake Mizerany in 2009! (aka creator of Sinatra)
The given repository from where the code was used was owned by Janko MarohniÄ‡ under MIT license also.

NOTE: I had to do it this way as there were compatiblity issues with MySQL. The plugin was not detected by including the gem.
