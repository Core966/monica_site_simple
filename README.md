Sinatra Kickstart Template
==========================

In short: Sinatra template, active record based, classic style, startout app with extensions that can be left intact or removed.

Concept:
This is a compact version of a complete application with all the code, written in simple understandable form, for you to see how it works, and learn from it.
All of the concepts covered in this application (like the use of manual SELECT queries) are intentional.
The main idea is to make a basic skeleton application but with ready made code examples which can be later tailored to your application.
In the end, this application framework skeleton will have several extensions which can be added or completely removed,
so if you need a typical application that has blog posts and comments, you can include the ready made extension on the fly without any additional work.
As this application is intended to solve problems which are rather done by Rails,
this application is mostly suited for familiarizing yourself with the concepts ready-made in the Rails framework.
If you have troubles learning the Rails framework, I would strongly advise you to dive into the code of this application or check any other Sinatra tutorials.

Current main version: 0.1 alpha

Blog extension version: 0.2 alpha

Please use this application at your own risk! It is not done yet!

How to use:

Install dependencies (bundle)

migrate (rake db:migrate)

Run Application (ruby core.rb)

Also, make sure to check the following:

rake -T

use Ruby 2.0.0 or greater

make sure you clean the data you are not using during testing, nothing is deleted!
